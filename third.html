    <p>Under the warm and bright skies, </p>
    <p>There was she with tender heart and smiling eyes.</p>
    <p>Windows of her soul is open to light,</p>
    <p>She always seems happy, bubbly and bright.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Her good deeds ,this universe never mentiojned, </p>
    <p>But still,vessel of her soul is filled with good intentions.</p>
    <p>Always trying to be considerate,</p>
    <p>But to push her down, this world is so desperate.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>She is passionate and has the spark,</p>
    <p>But destiny, always trying to put her in the dark.</p>
    <p>She's the brightest start in the gloomy night,</p>
    <p>But this cruel world left her uptight.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>The kindness in her eyes doesn't need any explaination,</p>
    <p>But the awful acts of the cruel world left her in vexation.</p>
    <p>But thank the lord, came into the light,</p>
    <p>Her friends and family who made that spark re-ignite.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Through all the thick n thins, their bonds will endure,</p>
    <p>To see the power of goodness, look at their love so pure.</p>
    <p>World say good intentions and modesty take you no where,</p>
    <p>See what she has earned, a beautiful circcle I sware.</p>
